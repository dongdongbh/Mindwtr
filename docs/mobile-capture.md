# Mobile Capture

Mindwtr Mobile now includes a lightweight capture screen at `/capture`.

## Deep‑link capture

You can open the capture modal with a URL like:

`mindwtr://capture?text=<url-encoded text>`

The screen pre‑fills the text and lets you confirm before adding to Inbox.  
It supports the same quick‑add syntax as desktop (`/due:…`, `/note:…`, `@context`, `#tag`, `+Project`).

## Share‑sheet integration

Mindwtr supports capture from the system share sheet:

1. In any app, tap **Share**
2. Choose **Mindwtr**
3. The content opens `/capture` prefilled

## Home widget (optional)

Add the Mindwtr widget (2x2) for one-tap capture and quick focus access.
