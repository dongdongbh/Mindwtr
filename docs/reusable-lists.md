# Reusable Lists (Templates)

Mindwtr supports reusable checklists for things you do repeatedly but **not** on a fixed schedule (e.g., packing lists, groceries).

## Two Patterns

### 1) Duplicate (Templates)
Use this for lists you want to copy and tweak each time.

Example: **Packing List**

1. Keep a master task in Someday/Maybe
2. Duplicate it when you plan a trip
3. Edit the copy without affecting the master

### 2) Reset Checklist
Use this for lists you want to reuse as-is.

Example: **Groceries**

1. Check off items as you buy them
2. Tap **Reset Checklist** to uncheck all items
3. Reuse next time

## Where to Find Actions

- **Mobile:** In the task editor, use **Duplicate task** or **Reset checklist**
- **Desktop:** Use the task actions menu
